### Custom Training of Regression Model in TensorFlow 2

In this code we explain how to train a regression model using only TensorFlow 2.x. With this code you can able to build any model in tensorflow with ease. This program also show to to visualize the model in tensoflow with developing in keras. By doing with it will be really helpful for the people who want to their won custom model.
